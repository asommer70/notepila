# Note Pila!

Note Pila! is a web based note taking app.  A pile of notes...

## Development

Uses React and simple CSS to create a one page application that changes out whole sections of the page depending on the action being taken.

At least that's the idea...


## Backend

Uses PouchDB to store Note data and sync with other devices.
